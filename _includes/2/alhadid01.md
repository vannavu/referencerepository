###### â€” *The Candle Clock in the Citadel* by Diana Al-Hadid, 2017. In which Al-Hadid attempts to reconstruct a complicated machine like a badass.

Diana Al-Hadid's talk on Wednesday was about historical synthesis and new form. It was new to witness an artist give a less prepared/scripted talk, as she seemed to intend. She was using the public space as a means of reflecting on work in a new setting, which probably put some people off as she searched for words. But to me it made her more empathetic. She's still figuring things out like everyone else. And the work as a collection speaks.

Her experiences show that the work is not coincidental, that it does not come from some mysterious, unknown source. Experimental Jetset calls on the same theme of origins in *Statement and Counter-Statement*. It's getting at the question:

## "What were my atoms before they were me?"

I've been thinking about the why's of what I do a lot; the roots are traceable, and influences are everywhere. My parents own a nail salon, and doing nails is not dissimilar to the practice of graphic design. Creative labor. A service. ... That's just one part of the big Why.
