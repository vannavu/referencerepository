I took an accidental glitch-panorama of the Arch the summer before senior year of high school. It reflected the state of St. Louis.

The summer of 2017 I studied abroad in Florence. Our final project was about collection and curation. One of my classmates/friends Laurie did hers on glitch panoramas. It resulted in many silly pictures, but in the end considered the possibilities of interaction for divided panels of panoramas.

The Sunday of Labor Day weekend, I went to the newly renovated Arch and took some more panoramas, this time deliberately contorting the Arch. The glitch panorama has a new meaning and association and is inseparable from Laurie's project now, for me and for the people I studied abroad with. Community impacts the work, and connotations can't be forgotten. But what do these photos mean to others?
