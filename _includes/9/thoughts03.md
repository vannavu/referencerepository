###### — *Seh-Texte* by Ferdinand Kriwet (1962), part of concrete art. Picture from *IDEA: typography today*.

The Herb Lubalin Study Center has all the *Dot Dot Dot* magazines, a lot of the *IDEA* mags, and *Emigre* publications—another reason why 2 hours there is not enough time.

In *Emigre 67* Rudy VanderLans interviews the type designer, writer, publisher, educator Peter Bil'ak. Bil'ak talks about the design and ideation process of making *Dot Dot Dot* and about why he makes type:

## “It's a constant oscillation between intuition and intellect, never just one or the other.”

“[Fedra (a typeface by Bil'ak)] is not directly repeating the past, nor is it predicting future trends. It is simply the product of now.” What makes a typeface contemporary? It's not definable. It just is.

Right now I am kind of scattered. When I think too much, I stop doing. But when I feel like I am not thinking enough, I don't feel as intentional, rational, purposeful. Every doing is a decision informed by something, but it doesn't take much for me to slip into conscious thinking. I can really only articulate what I've done after I've done it. Trying to define it before it's made sets these limiting, somewhat impossible limitations. It's basically trying to predict the future when really what matters is what you're doing now. This idea of emergence used to be pretty natural to me but it's been getting a little harder and harder because of the pressures of the future. Too much future. Not enough now.

What I'm starting to learn through the interaction capstone is to follow the essence of a form rather than trying to shape it to be something else. It's been more about expanding and resolving a form rather than solving a problem, which is a nice way of working, especially when you consider the purpose and possibility of an educational environment in comparison to a commercial/professional one.

One thing about type design that Ben Kiel told me (that Tal Leming originally told him) is that the type will reach a point where it starts to speak. The form itself will lead the way. It's kind of mysterious, but makes a lot of sense after it happens. It's not a conscious, fully articulable thing in the moment. And it's kind of how my whole life has panned out basically. You start out with a plan but it can never be determined completely.

So there's always been this emphasis on process over outcome, but even that is starting to become fuzzy. It's a tricky balance.

Maybe it's just all too much thinking, not enough making. Easier to observe what can be seen. Or to just not criticize too much in the moment of making but after the thing is made to exhaustion. Of course that was easier when I didn't know as much about design or how to talk about it. Ignorance is bliss.

I guess the approach I need to take is to just make, as I used to, without thinking too much about the why and the intent in the beginning. As much as that may seem to oppose Rationalization and Logic of design, I think it's more honest to say that a good chunk of meaning and reason comes of out interpreting a thing after it's made, after we can step out of the context of its making and view it afterward. I mean, that's what a crit is. I don't know. Maybe this is all a weird kind of performance anxiety. Things just always go better when I just go my own way and make stuff without outside expectation.
