Alexander Tochilovsky, head curator of the Herb Lubalin Study Center, on Lubalin’s convictions and skill, the inaccuracy of Google, and Karl Gerstner’s systems.

WashU's art library also has a copy of Gerstner's *Designing Programmes*. Not sure how I feel about such a rationalized approach quite yet, but this quote,

## “The rules of the game is permutation”
###### — Paul Gredinger, *Pro-Programmitic*, introduction to *Designing Programmes* (pg.3)

defines design for me, in regard to how each individual design is made but also how design as a collection evolves. Another interesting perspective is:

## “Instead of solutions for problems, programmes for solutions … The creative process is to be reduced to an act of selection. Designing means: to pick out determining elements and combine them.”
###### — Karl Gerstner

This is how I've felt about design. It feels like a big game of collage and synthesis. I'm more interested in working at the more micro/fundamental levels of its existence, like type design (can't have a lot of design without typography, and can't have typography without type). Type is just abstract yet just material enough. It sits at such a nice intersection. It really is its own thing.
