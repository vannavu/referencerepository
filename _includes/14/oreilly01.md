*[Everything](http://www.everything-game.com/){:target="_blank"}* is a game made by David OReilly (he is against apostrophes). I found out about it through [TCI](https://thecreativeindependent.com/wisdom/david-oreilly-on-making-sure-you-keep-going/#1){:target="_blank"} (OReilly is blunt and straightforward). The flopping animals are great. It reflects the fundamental abstractness of  digital media, how the physics of it are not actually governed by reality. The game allows people to explore the world from a variety of scales and perspectives as well as explore the absurdity of abundance. OReilly's works have been acclaimed for being in between a game, interactive experience, and film.
