###### — Nemesis font in use by [Amalgam journal](http://www.amalgam.online/){:target="_blank"}

I came across Nemesis by [Baptiste Bernazeau](http://baptiste.bernazeau.eu/){:target="_blanket"} several weeks ago. It's a unique example of playing with ambiguous letterforms and the importance of context in reading. The ambiguities are not predictable ones since they are customized and possible by the typeface's aesthetic structure. In a generalized view we think of d as a mirrored b, 6 as an upside-down 9, etc. Here Bernazeau makes X and M synonymous, Z and E, and potentially S and 8 and G and 6. This is a way of “compressing” the data of written language by reducing the number of distinct characters. What's common in these projects that link letterforms is that it's typically done in a binary way. Can written language still be readable with an alphabet that stays as 26 letters with only 13 visual forms?

The English language has somehow managed to boil it down to 26 letters. I still find that kind of amazing.
