###### — letters generated with the Pattern Type App

Eike Dingler, a TypeMedia graduate, created a [pattern type](https://ilovetypography.com/2015/06/17/the-pattern-project/){:target="_blank"} inspired by the historical decorated type, such as those found in the style of the Book of Kells, and generative art. But his pattern type and how it was attempted to be made accessible is not too successful to me. Though he considered how the patterns fit into the letterform, it just doesn't feel worth it as a typeface. The connection from his inspiration to his idea makes sense. It's just missing that sense of awe and durability.

It makes sense that the letterform shapes are geometric since the pattern modules are geometric, and because the monolinear structure makes things legible and contemporary. It's just kind of boring and overdone for geometric sans serif to take the weight of all pattern / multiplied type.

The GIF above is more successful—though in this case it is also typography and not just type design. But it's more successful because the pattern interacts with its environment.
