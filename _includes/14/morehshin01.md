Moreshin Allahyari came to WashU to give a talk. I still haven't fully processed her additivist purpose and use of 3D printing; it's interesting but doesn't completely resonate to me right now, but I can see myself better understanding it eventually. Currently I struggle with being ok that I'm not really good at making art for social and political good. But in any case, I found the implant of SD cards into the 3D prints quite nice, and her idea of archiving as an art practice and making technological objects a visible part of the art. A tool becomes the art. The act of preservation reminds me of scholarship in type design, how type designers revive type that has fallen into disuse or that has been forgotten and how many document their source material. The things we make are prone to being forgotten, and it seems important to preserve cultural objects of today. Without them, a part of history is lost and so evidence of truth is lost.

She also mentioned the poetics of technology, which I am also interested in.

She also touched on this sort of fetishization or sort of high regard for studying cultures outside of the one we live in, when the one we grew up in has value too. Her work is a form of resistance as she says, and preservation is a form of persistence in such a volatile world.
