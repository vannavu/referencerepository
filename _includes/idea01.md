###### — pg. 110, quoting Karl Gerstner, set in Gerstner Original

*Idea Document: On the Shoulders of Giants*: Notable problem is that this features mostly white European guys. But that goes for most type design books. Insightful nonetheless. Learned about Gernster's font that intends to synthesize serif and sans, as well as André Ballinger's Newut Tip, which is “an attempt to create a new universal typeface.“

“German texts always had a more ragged grayscale than the Latinate or Anglo-Saxon texts due to many capitalised words. When looking at the German immediately next to the other languages, it always draws slightly more attention visually.” (All nouns in German are capitalized.)
Baldinger, (*IDEA Document: On the Shoulders of Giants*, pg. 104).

The dots stand in for accent marks. Since words are understood in context, the dots work.
