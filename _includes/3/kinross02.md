*Modern Typography* — Robin Kinross: Thoughts prompted by Chapter 2: Enlightenment Origins

## “Modern typography exhibits a rational impulse, both internally in ordering its own working, and externally in the face it presents to the world.”
###### — pg. 16

“By a typographer, I do not mean a printer, as he is vulgarly accounted, any more than Dr Dee means a carpenter or mason to be an architect: but by a typographer, I mean such a one, who by his own judgement, from solid reasoning within himself, can either perform, or direct others to perform from the beginning to the end, all the handy-works and physical operations relating to typographie.” (Joseph Moxon, *Mechanik exercises: or the doctrine of handy-works applied to the art of printing*, quoted by Kinross pg. 15).

A typographer is as much as a practitioner as a reasoner, and these things can be taught. Typography is based in reason and rational thought, but it is not a science.

##### — romain du roi italic

Romain du roi introduced units for different body sizes and using the grid.
It represents the move toward rationalization and order, and anticipates pixels and how fonts are constructed today (a fine grid of points).

A possibly incorrect assumption of mine: Italics are rooted in handwriting, so what happens when you try to apply that to a grid? An effect of rectilinear units and coordinates is that it leads to sloped romans instead of true italics, which precedes the oblique styles of sans serifs.

Chapter 3: The Nineteenth-Century Complex: Printing was full of working-class labor, roots of underserved, arduous workers:

“They quit, they cheated on their ‘voyage’; they collected small advances on the next week’s work (‘salé’) and then disappeared; and sometimes they spied for rival publishers or the police.” (p.27, Kinross quoting historian of book production in 18th century France). A reminder that things were way more intense back then.

Hard labor motivated workers to take shortcuts to make the work easier, not dissimilar to type designers today using programming and scripting to automate tedious and repetitive processes. Some say it allows more time to be allotted toward designing instead of pixel pushing.

Chapter 4: Reaction and Rebellion:

## “The idea of freedom (‘as having skilled and unaffected boldness’) was essential to [Edward Johnston], as was that of constraint: ‘True spontaneity, however, seems to come from *working by rule*, but not being bound by it’...‘Set no limit to your hopes (which may contemplate Eternity) but every limit of the moment to your work’”
