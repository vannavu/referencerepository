###### — [Viktor](http://juerglehni.com/works/viktor){:target="_blank"}, robotic chalk drawing machine

Was reintroduced to [Jürg Lehni](http://juerglehni.com/){:target="_blank"}, and looking at his work beyond [Apple Talk](http://juerglehni.com/works/apple-talk){:target="_blank"} got me thinking about not just human error affecting digital platforms, but how Earth's physics affect precise, programmed tools.

## The physics of the internet vs. the physics of Earth

His project “Viktor” is also a nice resolution of the conflict between genuine roughness of material and electronically powered machines.

Jürg was also one of the people who made Scriptographer. Go figure.

The intersection of type, tech, and our relationship to digital forms and the internet is where it's at.
