###### — [NON Dit-Dah font](https://formistfoundry.co/products/non-dit-dah){:target="_blank"}

Formist is releasing limited edition fonts in a series called NON. The types are intended to “form a new universal language,” which kind of doesn't make sense if the font is limited to 10 copies... and because the letters are also not legible. In any case, a universal language is not achievable. Right now. Well actually it's not immediately legible but you could learn how to read it... It's not dissimilar to cuneiform or hangul. It's alt-English.

Dit-Dah is based on the forms of morse code, and its dot/line modules were used to construct approximations of letterforms. “This system simultaneously acknowledges both the written letterform and transmitted code form, and in turn, forms a third abstracted universal language.”

Not sure how I feel about the idea of a limited edition font. It's kind of breaking my brain to think about it and the physics of digital “material.”
