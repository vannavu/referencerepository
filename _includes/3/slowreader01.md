*Slow Reader: A Resource for Design Thinking and Practice* — Ana Paula Pais & Carolyn F. Strauss (eds.)

Part of the “Long List of *Rational* Reasons of Why I Like Type Design” is that making a typeface takes a long time. It's a nice contrast to the rush and immediacy of everything else. The speed of graphic design can sometimes make it feel quite meaningless.

Something that has been stuck in my head is:

## ephemeral design,
## ephemeral emotion

You know when you hold something and it's just full of emotion? That's usually because someone put a lot of time and care into it.

The speed in which we design and produce work is tied to life's timeline and capitalist demands. But not everything is precious and needs years to be made. The alternative of a gradual work is just *nice*. It's somewhat of a protest.

With that said, the essays in this book so far touch on systems and language (or at least that's what I'm choosing to pull out):

“We must learn about how the place where we are is forced upon us in its being, how the powers that be determine our lives, and how we can keep agency in that, and bring our own idea of a relationship.” (pg. 47, “Preparing for the Not-Yet” by Jeanne Van Heeswijk)

“We see words from the economic sphere being applied in the artistic and cultural spheres. A few examples in which I think language really betrays us: to capitalize (ideas), to produce (art), ‘work’ (instead of oeuvre), strategy and ‘projects’ when we refer to the process of creation, while at the same time we let creativity be co-opted by corporate language.

...The lack of criticality and self-reflection in the educational system, the lack of freedom, is intentionally designed as a political instrument. We witness a deliberate imposition on the child of a model of life based on the logic of automatism and the idea of professionalism, which does not allow the child to develop a certain sensitivity.” (pg. 76–77, “The Art of Conversation and the Aesthetic of Process” by Emilio Fantin)

“Often we feel trapped in one system, and we feel the system is so much larger than we are; but we are the ones who are keeping that system going. So once you recognize the inequity, and trace how your own body is being disciplined and kept in a certain place, you can begin to think through how you might design intervention, as a creator of cultural material.” (pg. 90, “Decolonization As Care” by Uzma Z. Rizvi)

## “In all of my experience, however, the mode of resistance has only ever worked through collaboration, finding allies and solidarity with others.”
