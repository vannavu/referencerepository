In bookbinding my professor mostly only ever references either Ken Botnick or Tauba Auerbach.

Warranted.

Auerbach makes a lot of books and she also has a series of fonts that begin with the same rectilinear proportions. Each one then forms from a matrix.

Looking at [all her type specimen](https://diagonalpress.com/collections?cat=posters){:target="_blank"}, patterns in letterform structure crop up, such as the Christian-cross T's. To Auerbach, these types are personal, a “visualization” of her voice. They are not commercial/retail typefaces. Despite their logical matrices, they don't come off strictly mechanical but rather idiosyncratically programmatic. They are also related to the whole body of her work in how physical and digital forms influence each other and how false dimension is created.

The Five Strand Woven for example ties into the [series of woven canvases](http://www.taubaauerbach.com/view.php?id=408){:target="_blank"}. This font references a handicraft that isn't calligraphy or pen-based.
