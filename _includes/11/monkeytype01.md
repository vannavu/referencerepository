Oh-ooh-ah-ah-ahh-ahhh: Monkey Type is an anonymous foundry “based on the internet”. The concept of their not-serious foundry is a response to the high-brow, pedantic type world. But they're fully aware of their own ridiculousness in making type and working on an s for three years.

But they just made another grotesk font. The framing of a practice and a foundry maybe means just as much as the work. Oof.
