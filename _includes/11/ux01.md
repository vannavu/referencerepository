"[Skeuomorphism, Flat Design and The Rise of Type Design](https://uxplanet.org/typography-user-interface-nothing-else-738a7cf6a954){:target="_blank"}" â€” Michael Abehsera: Found this article after googling something along the lines of "skeuomorphic type design". Abehsera presents a somewhat questionable approach to UI design, but I get what he's attempting. He proposes "Type Design" (a confusing term considering that type design exists) as the next level of minimalism for UI, moving past skeuomorphism, material design, and flat design.

A lot of interfaces are just text in boxes. So why still bother with boxes, basically. The role of image in UI design is the text-image: type carries the tone but it also is the navigation and the info. Abehsera also argues that it'd be easier to maintain and make. Lazy? His main motivation is for efficiency and ease of maintenance. But he also thinks the reduction in elements makes for a clearer and cleaner design.
