[Sintétik](http://www.quiresiste.com/projet.php?id_projet=15&lang=en&id_gabarit=0): “ruthlessly compresses language” by making homophonous syllables be spelled the same way. This reduction in redundancy reminds me of how Jan Tschichold pushed for unicase type designs since A and a make the same sound (but he fails to acknowledge that they can serve different purposes).

[Quantange](http://www.quiresiste.com/projet.php?id_projet=48&lang=en&id_gabarit=0): an attempt at visualizing sound with form (tying phonetics closer to visuals) in the French language.

[Basnoda](http://www.quiresiste.com/projet.php?id_projet=16&lang=en&id_gabarit=0): “for the setting of a vertical, palindromic sentence by Georges Perec. It reads, upright, from left to right, then from left to right - though in this latter case upside down.”

[3 par 3 (3 by 3)](http://www.quiresiste.com/projet.php?id_projet=52&lang=en&id_gabarit=0): “A character designed on a grid of three squares by three = 9 squares. This is not many. I have attempted the same on a grid of 1 square by 1. The result had great rigour, but was a little monotonous.” (ha)

[Zebra](http://www.quiresiste.com/projet.php?id_projet=53&lang=en&id_gabarit=0): an i with 4 tittles! What would a seriffed serif look like?
