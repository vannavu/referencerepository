## Interpretations of old form made contemporary

These are examples of contemporary type that resonated with me before I knew why they did:

Back when I was taught the value of typefaces and type design, I was introduced to Klim. Pitch made me a bit more aware of what type could be, how it could really make someone react. Why does it look so good to me? It's hit me for 3 reasons, each one articulated at different times the more I have looked at:

1: It's beautiful. And crisp without feeling cold.
2: Pitch has a very specific feel, a synthesis of digital and analogue that recalls but does not imitate typewritten text.
3: The one move of geometric bracketed serifs defines Pitch's entire character (which is why that move also appears where strokes join in the sans version). Instead of trying to imitate ink spread, Sowersby fills those missing pieces with pure shape.

This is a great example of contemporary type informed by historical precedent that doesn't look dated or completely derivative. Sowersby also wrote an insight that proves that he's aware of the contemporary digital environment in his essay "[10000 Original Copies](https://klim.co.nz/blog/10000-original-copies/){:target="_blank"}":

## “I was trying to capture an impossible aesthetic, that I was trying to mimic a technology that isn’t used. So I decided to make it as ‘digital’ as possible, to be ‘true’ to the spirit of the thing. I made the points infinitely sharp, I detailed it to be contemporary and rigourous. I want it to be a product of our time and our digital culture.”

In the beginning of the article he also makes explicit:

## “letters [are] now divorced from lead and married to light”

Abstraction of physical type's byproducts or the complete removal of those material artifacts is key to making contemporary web type not look imitative. Type needs to be self-aware of its environment.

Dala Prisma was made possible with scripting. It would have taken a lot longer to draw this face without the help of programming. Again, this is beautiful. It was inspired by the striped type Prisma which was more manageable to draw because of the monolinear, geometric strokes. Dala Prisma applies stripes to a Victorian shape, creating the great beach ball effect and the "infinitely sharp", tapering stripes.

Pitch and Dala Prisma possess no material noise. They're crisp. Even though their forms are all inspired by material historical precedent made with different technology, there's no erosion or ink splatter. Because now it's all light behind a frictionless glass screen. Type norms of serifs and ball terminals persist, though abstracted. Is that what makes a good type? Accessible in its contemporaneity, not abstracted to uselessness or unfamiliarity or dully derivative of history?
