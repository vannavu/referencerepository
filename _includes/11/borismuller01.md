[Why Do All Websites Look the Same?](https://medium.com/s/story/on-the-visual-weariness-of-the-web-8af1c969ce73){:target="_blank"} — Boris Müller:

## “Templates are content agnostic”

An unanswered question I've been having is if type revival is a form of appropriation, and if it matters if type designers that heavily reference historical form also consider the social, political, etc. context of that type's time. I don't want to assume that designers just pull type they formally like and that's that, but sometimes it kind of comes off that way, or they try to frame it as a historical ode. For what? Credibility in validating their own type? There's a lot of rhetoric to unpack. But I guess the truth is in the type designs themselves. Are serifs merely attachments, or do they hold some connotation? Does their origin from handwriting really matter anymore?

“Sometimes, if you want to design the future, you have to rediscover the past.”

Back to thinking in terms of websites, not type: Naïve but well-meaning form that was created because no conventional model existed at the time is *priceless*. Unlearning is hard.
