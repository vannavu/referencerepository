###### — Beowolf font by LettError (Erik van Blokland & Just van Rossum)

##### — Bitmap type from first MacOS

This past week has been trying to dig further into what "digitally native" type means, and trying to figure out a wording that makes this idea accessible and understandable without undermining it.

When I think of precedents for digitally native type, bitmap fonts are the first. They reflect their environment's constraints and aren't bitmap for the sake of being bitmap — they *had* to be bitmap. That's digitally native, not imitative like "bitmap" fonts made today, which look inherently dated. Such a rigorous constraint to letterform means that glyphs first try to follow the general structure of a letter, the very skeleton.

Serifs and contrast and optical correction don't make a letter; they make a typeface that suits convention to some degree. What makes a letter is its basic structure that makes it recognizable as such. An E is one vertical line with 3 horizontal lines attached to the right of it — even that definition may not be specific enough. What happens when different language is used to describe letterform? Instead of strokes and serifs, what if boxes and attachments were the terms?

Another typeface I consider to be digitally native is LettError's Beowolf. It directly exposes letters as data, code, points. Randomness and animation and the layering of light-based color. But still visible is its traditional roots: serifs and contrast.

## Is seriffed type on the screen skeuomorphic?

The common practice in type design today is to revive or heavily reference historical form and convention. How else can type design be practiced, particularly in regard to web fonts? How can we look more toward the now? How does the digital environment affect type and how can the process of type design and letterform itself attempt to reflect the qualities of the contemporary digital environment? These are questions of curiosity rather than opposition or pursuit of a dogmatism.
