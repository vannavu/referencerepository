PEOPLE music gathering and website: “Music is for everyone.” A non-hierarchical, non-commercial digital space for artists (mostly musicians) to upload and update unfinished work. Includes some background information on when and where the pieces started.

Note the language: *people* instead of *solo artists*, *projects* instead of *bands*—reflects the in-progress work (or past sketches) but also the ideology of PEOPLE.

Also note the typography: monospace and all caps of PEOPLE representing equality.

The gathering itself is unscheduled and spontaneous "performances" consist of in-progress work developed during the gathering.

## "You look at our capitalist society and people who are so enthralled with themselves and their own stories because they're afraid to die. They're afraid to stop expanding ... You don't need to expand, you don't need to become Walmart."
