I've been more curious about translations from digital to physical that expose the instable structures of the internet and that highlight how the properties of screens and physical structures are different. But what I've been making more of are translations from physical to digital, like GIFs of old projects.

I need to explore going from digital to physical I think. I'm still thinking about a phone-sized, non-linear zine and printing some sort of infinite scroll with a commercial thermal receipt printer.

I need to just do it. Because the work is more coherent than all these thoughts.
