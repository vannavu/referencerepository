Thoughts so far—

I'm not really interested in closed-control or specifically designed outcomes. Even if the outcome is unexpected for other people, it's more satisfying when the outcome is unexpected for everyone. I want to learn from other people's makings as much as my own. I'm interested in open-ended systems. It's also why I'm interested in tools and type design. Tools carry the creation of something else. A typeface needs to be used, not just displayed, and it's meaning changes as it is used. Letters are sensitive but not precious.

I still keep thinking about the idea of text-based communities. What could they be, beyond a forum or something like Twitter?

## What is truly native about the browser?

A lot of sites function to redirect us to content. What about stand-alone sites? How can an experience be native to its environment, rather than a metaphor of something that exists? Everything is metaphor, a translation. What about the raw materials and ideas of the internet?

That's what atom≠pixel means: the base units of digital and analog are not the same, so the larger structures created from that are not equivalent. So why attempt translation from physical to digital? Basically, art serving to be  representational vs. art as art.

I'm wondering about making the intangible structures of the internet/browser explicit, its expanding rectangles, link pathways, but also its relationship to the whole world—because again, the internet has expanded the dimension of the world; it's not another, separate world.

So instead of thinking of the internet as branches of “walled gardens”, I'm trying to think of it as one room expanding (like in the Sims 4...).

Because the webpage or Google Doc is an organic (but potentially immortal), editable document, eternal as the same object but ephemeral in its appearance, function, state, etc. Like a piece of land. That can be copy and pasted. But not named the same.

What is natural about the internet? It's completely man-made. We've built this expansion, but do we understand it?

I'm seeing why investigating the internet for what it *is*, content-wise and structurally, rather than whether it's good or bad is a way of understanding it. Since the internet is not a separate world but a layer of it, it will proportionally reflect the dominant culture of commercialism and commerce. But it's not just that (and it's not realistic to think of it as something where commercialism and commerce are the minority).

The internet vs. an internet: it's whatever you want it to be.
