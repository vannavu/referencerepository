In my Modern and Contemporary Chinese Art History class, we learned about the Modern Woodcut Movement, in which woodblock artists now designed, carved, and printed their art. Before, the steps were divided: an artist would send their drawing to be carved and printed by other people.

The claim of whole artistic control is similar to how graphic design has panned out. Graphic designers do their own typography, and there is also a move toward making one's own type as well. Being in control is probably why I'm annoyed with predetermined templates and structures. I like building things from scratch. So maybe that is why I don't want to enforce a closed environment on other people.
