Good ol' Jim came to St. Louis and gave a talk / exhibited Type Hike at UMSL.

I learned about kopimism. Again questioning what the internet has done to religion.

To the main point: Jim talked about how Squarespace and Instagram made Type Hike possible due the short timeframe they had to make it and the amount of manpower they had (2 people). This was a perspective that I was sort of looking for. I kind of have a bias against quickly constructing templated sites and the amount of promotion on social media. But that's just me and my purposes. If Squarespace and Instagram can support nonprofits making cool things and connecting people, why fight it. It's all about how they're used (mind the motivations of most of the ~~users~~ people). It kind of goes back to creating alternate systems instead of fighting against a system that wasn't designed for your purposes anyway.

I am also put to sleep by elongated discussions on branding for the most part, so Jim's talk on experimental processes and being an independent designer was nice. Most commercial design caters to safe, unprovocative design. If you don't want to do that, then change your environment. Design is what you choose it to be, if you're willing to accept the compromises. People have trouble with the demands of commercial design and the urge for personal expression and experimentation. They get trapped in the system. Jim went to grad school after getting sick of making “visual garbage” at a design firm and then just started building his practice after that. Easier said than done. But the point is to go for it. Maybe you'll get lucky.

## Don't dawdle.

I wish he talked more about being an educator, so I asked him how teaching affects his practice. He said that it keeps him honest since you should practice what you preach, that it makes sure he doesn't remain complacent, and that he's always exposed to new ideas. I also wonder if it's a kind of antidote to doing commercial work. Which I am at theoretical odds with.

Biggest takeaway from the dude is to be a supportive human.
