## “Poems are not meant to be functional. Poems are more exploratory, and poems are expressive and very human. We looked at code that way.”
###### — Taeyoon Choi

Taeyoon also specifies my (and the general) idea of code as language by considering it as figurative language. The way I see it and have been approaching design is a visualization of language. It's all metaphor. That's why coding is nice. It feels like writing. It's a different, more direct translation of written word to form.

How can the process of design also be the metaphor?
