Earlier in the year I inadvertently wrote a whole essay about why I like to make things from scratch and why I was experiencing quite a bit of friction with the dominant Adobe Suite in how it may perpetuate conventions and defaults if used as one's main *creative* tool. Wanting to make my own type and build my own tools and digital, creative environments kind of made me just feel like I was being a huge control freak. But really those feelings reflect something larger: the lack of agency and control.

On Wednesday I found out about one of the School for Poetic Computation (SFPC) founders, [Taeyoon Choi](http://taeyoonchoi.com){:target="_blank"} via [TCI](https://thecreativeindependent.com/people/taeyoon-choi-on-drawing-teaching-disability-and-the-difference-between-work-and-project/){:target="_blank"}. And he said exactly what I've been thinking:

## “I find commercial software kills my creativity. It’s designed to do something very professional, like a production tool. In the beginning, I felt like I couldn’t really go underneath and truly understand its interface … I’m sculpting with signals. I understand what’s happening, and I can control the behavior of my robots or sound installation. It’s very immediate. Unlike commercial software, like Photoshop, nobody has decided things for me. It’s an open plane to be creative. I can understand every single step.”

I've been wrestling with systems (following existing ones, going against existing ones, creating new ones), and what appeals to me most is creating my own systems and rules because I can understand how the whole thing works. Everything can be shaped for my individual intent rather than for a larger system or agenda, because as designers, form-givers, we must use tools to create. So how much truer can our idea be if we design our own tools? Look at what we're making in the browser compared to what we make in Illustrator or InDesign. I am taking all these rules of microinteractions and Laws of UX that we're reading about with a grain of salt. It's hard to unlearn.

But the issue I have with creating my own systems is that I can tend to rationalize on idealistic, idiosyncratic terms instead of realistic, more general terms. That can make it hard for people to understand what's going on, and it's not considered “practical.” But what's nice is that in today's society of systems, creating a new one is a way of exposing a new perspective. Idealism is possibility not yet realized. It's different than utopianism.
