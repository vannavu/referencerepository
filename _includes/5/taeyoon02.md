Right now in the capstone course we are oriented toward calculated, controlled experiences, some involving designed “randomness”. It's all really nuanced, which is actually kind of scary. Manipulation is everywhere. There's a lot of responsibility in designing these things. Is the illusion of agency dishonest and unethical?
