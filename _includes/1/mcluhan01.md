*The Gutenberg Galaxy: The Making of Typographic Man* — Marshall McCluhan

## "By the same process whereby he spins language out of his own being, he ensnares himself in it; and each language draws a magic circle round the people to which it belongs, a circle from which there is no escape save by stepping out of it into another."
###### — Wilhelm von Humboldt

Learning different languages—linguistic, visual, etc.—enables comparison to one's defaults (more perspective).

## "By the meaningless sign linked to the meaningless sound we have built the shape and meaning of Western man."
###### — Marshall McCluhan

The alphabet is completely abstract, yet it's the reason why anything is possible at all.
