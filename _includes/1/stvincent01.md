[St. Vincent Is the 21st Century's Guitar Vanguard â€” Sasha Geffen](https://www.npr.org/2018/08/20/638896447/st-vincent-is-the-21st-centurys-guitar-vanguard) (NPR):

## "Thinking of [the] guitar as a peer and not a tool."

Coincides with the thought of using code as a language, a form of thinking and communicating and not just a tool rather for efficiency. Not only using the computer, but collaborating with it. Specifying code even more, what can you do in browser that you can't do in Python? Or, how can browser  restrictions influence a design?

"Forget the glass ceiling. Inside a St. Vincent song, you don't even know where the floor is." Unexpected, poetic moments vs. novel animations.
