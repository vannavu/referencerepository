The cultural biography assignment was an overall failure because of how tangential the prompt was and how high-stakes yet non-valuable the paper was.

Integrating writing into the design practice could be a great thing for some. It's a mode of criticism, another lens of making. Participating in discourse is important for asking what we're doing, for questioning why things are the way they are. What's unfortunate about the cultural biography is how it was framed and how that affected the reception of it and the reaction against it.

"If you don't do it, your grade will drop by a letter."

Wasn't even announced.

Then suddenly just a day before it's due: "If you don't do it, you won't get to participate in capstone." Imposing fear is great. Totally not manipulative.

Also, it was never really clearly communicated why this assignment would be helpful. "It may help with realizing some stuff." Basically.

Researching methodology or better understanding why we like a certain design feels more salient, and it's much more motivating to write about something like that.

What pisses me off the most is just that no one cared that much to put in time into the paper, because why? Most people slacked because it's not for a grade. Grade motivation isn't what any of this should be about.

It was just busy work for everyone. It got in the way of class time and work time.

I guess it was an attempt at being more interdisciplinary. But as designers it already feels like we're expected to know how to do every goddamn thing. It's up to us to choose what we want to explore. Not everyone is a writer. But we're all makers.

Design education: it's hard to curate. We're all being stretched thin.
