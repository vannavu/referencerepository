###### — [Lynö](https://radimpesko.com/fonts/lyno){:target="_blank"} by Radim Pe&scaron;ko & Karl Nawrot

[From Pe&scaron;ko's site](https://radimpesko.com/fonts/lyno){:target="_blank"}: “They are open and various, and their spirit is this: to resist normative tendencies and to reject the idea of definitive form.”

The thing is, all legible letters are normative and definitive in the skeletal sense. Letters are shapes, but not strictly defined ones... it's hard to write the definition of an A, because it also depends on the context of the other letters in the typeface. When you see or read an A, it is an A. Letters are not like circles and squares which are mathematically definable.

Lynö is able to work because it is still based on the alphabet. As whacky as it may look, it's really not *that* crazy because it's all still readable. That's what makes it usable and worth making. The ability to call Lynö a type family is also based on proportion and stroke weight. An consistent color is present.

Still some questionable things: why were some of the letters in the font Jean not mutated? Anyway, Jean is the one I see used most often from Lynö. It gives a weird inky materiality to the letters.
