[Caligraft](http://www.caligraft.com/abstract/){:target="_blank"} is a project by Ricard Marxer Piñón about “crafting computational calligraphies”.

[Examples](https://www.google.com/search?q=caligraft&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjnnbjijP_eAhXnmOAKHZMSAjkQ_AUIECgD&biw=720&bih=767#imgrc=yNDmx37a-hyr0M:){:target="_blank"}

Not about imitating or simulating calligraphy, but reconsidering what motion can mean in the digital context, with influence by generative art.

The website is also pretty outdated and slow, not even loading anymore. How can websites be archived yet remain interactive?
