###### — found on Erik Carter's Are.na channel “Do you want typography or do you want the truth”; [block is by Desmond Wong](https://www.are.na/block/514209){:target="_blank"}, which he found on the terrifying website [Fight for UX](https://fightforux.com/?utm_campaign=UX_Design_Weekly_Issue_67&utm_medium=email&utm_source=uxdesignweekly.com){:target="_blank"}

Hilarious. But oh man. Is UX only accessible through homogenous practices?

Reminds me of [Laws of UX](https://lawsofux.com/){:target="_blank"}. And my reaction to that was skeptical, but not as negative as my reaction toward [Fight for UX](https://fightforux.com/?utm_campaign=UX_Design_Weekly_Issue_67&utm_medium=email&utm_source=uxdesignweekly.com){:target="_blank"}, which uses American propaganda figures to relay their message for a "humanist" but aesthetically militant (and perhaps fundamentally capitalist and impersonal) view toward UX.

It also reminds me of how the microinteractions textbook can be somewhat dogmatic. It's all in service of the "user". I mean it's not all untrue, but it's not quite encouraging of redefining best practices and expanding conventions. Why is it important to look beyond convention if it's accessible? Because conventions are products of a different time that may reflect misaligned values. Re: consumerism and capitalism.

Why do I resonate with Taeyoon Choi and the School for Poetic Computation moreso than these practical, industrial, potentially superficially empathethic/humanist UX guides?

~~Control~~ Care.

The language these sites (Laws of UX, Fight for UX, School for Poetic Computation), visual and written, is also all really powerful in how I choose to interpret them.
