[Vocabularies of Computation: An Interview with Kyuha (Q) Shim](https://walkerart.org/magazine/kyuha-q-shim-interview-computation-design){:target="_blank"}:

## “After all, there are many ways to draw an outlined circle.”

“Computation is, first and foremost, my primary medium. It is a lens with which and through which I take an analytical perspective to see things as generative pattern, a combination of parameters and algorithms. Not everything is made out of rules, but I love to decode logic encrypted in artifacts. At the same time, computation is a material with which I build systems that can automatically repeat tasks, which yields continuity and actually feels like real-time. It enables me to play with contingent, complex, data-driven, and improvisational aspects of formation.”

The interviewer also asks,

## “Can an algorithm have style?”

Shim responds by saying that depending on the rules, yes, an algorithm can have style due to the visual patterns that it creates.
