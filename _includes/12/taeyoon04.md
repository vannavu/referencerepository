*[Poetic Computation: Reader](http://poeticcomputation.info/contents/){:target="_blank}*: Taeyoon Choi wrote a book about poetic computation that was supposed to fully released by now but unfortunately only 3 chapters are available as of now. He elaborates on the role that poetics of code can play on aesthetics and how understanding the mechanisms can unlock the language of these programmed processes.

## “Repetition is a powerful way to perform complex tasks by breaking them down into a series of a simple operations, enabling a basic pattern to scale to larger, more abstract and complex structures. We might note that repetition is also an essential technique of poetry. The images, in their abstraction, also hold a sense of the sublime for me. The sublime is the experience of something that is beyond judgment, such as having a transcendent encounter with nature. This sublime elegance in computation propelled me to ask if we could use these aesthetics to envision a different narrative of technology.”

Describing the computational poetics as a form of the sublime is just right. I've been trying to articulate it, but it is not completely able to be articulated, only observed and experienced.

He also describes immaterial drawing, seemingly boundless, as “free drawing in the air.”

We're pressured to commercialize what we learn. I mean, one kind of has to to make money? Not really sure how I'm going to harmonize with capitalism as someone who is uncompetitive with hardly any entrepreneurial spirit, who also has trouble with hierarchy and authority.
