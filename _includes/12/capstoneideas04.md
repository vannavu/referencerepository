## Craft and automation

What is the role of craft today? What can craft mean?

It could be seen as a resistance against the inhuman speed of automation. Craft is largely repetitive, demanding patience and precision and care from the crafter. These tasks could be automated, but at times the emotional care put into making physical objects can be absent. Each mistake from the machine is a huge distraction, just as a craftsman's carelessness. Automation is a means of getting to the middle of the process quicker, not always as a means to the end.

## How can automation be poetic and not just industrially efficient?

In bookbinding we had to make two coptic-stich books in about 2 weeks basically. The binding takes longer to do since it's designed for larger books, and it also requires more practice to make a decently put-together book. Our previous projects had max 15 pages of content, and for this one we were required to make two books with, at minimum, 120 pages each. So there was this problem of practicing the binding and having to fill several pages. There was no way I was going to fill the pages with hand-drawn things or collages and whatnot, at least not in a personally conceptually fulfilling way in such a short amount of time.

I probably ended up spending just as much time as anyone else who drew in their books. I chose to quantify a lifetime in a book by automating a year's worth of dates for each spread of my book. I ended up making a 206 page book, which meant more time required for binding, since the coptic bind is threaded signature by signature. The book is an inherently modular and repetitive structure and bookbinding is consequently a repetitive task: cutting sheets of paper, scoring and folding each sheet, creating signatures, punching holes in each signature, repeating stitching patterns and motions of the arms.

It was kind of jarring designing the book. I used a spreadsheet to generate a year's worth of dates starting from September 9, 1997 (the day I was born). Then I just used find and replace in InDesign for each spread to change the year. Passing from 1997 to 2018 and finally to 2096 (an ambitious year to live to) was surreal. 2050? What the heck is 2050 gonna be like? The years just gradually increase with each page turn. The days that I had already lived were  striked-through. Future dates to be crossed out post-printing will be crossed out with a pen. It's an impersonal journal of sorts. No day's content, just an acknowledgement of its passing.

Some people were freaked out in thinking that I typed out my entire book date by date. The scale and the repetition of the book is inhuman. But the craft was entirely hand-done/body-generated, including the guillotine-cut text block (which destroyed one edge of my book). One person called it an uneconomical calendar, which I didn't even think about. I saw the text block as a poetic thing, less so of a utilitarian design. The book isn't “finished” until I die.

Anyway it's always nice to make a thing that actually garners a reaction of some sort and that considers the form of the book. I was questioning the value of printed type specimen, but it they're actually quite valuable for archival purposes. Archiving digital material is still a volatile thing. Books are great. They won't die, even if reading changes.

Now I'm trying to figure out how the form of the book can influence web design—but I'm thinking it should largely remain separate. How the web and coding can influence book design/content, though, is the more intriguing question.
