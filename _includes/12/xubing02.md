###### – “art for the people”

Xu Bing created a writing system called “[square word calligraphy](https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/73325){:target="_blank"}” that formally looks Chinese but is actually legible (for the most part) to English readers. The more legible calligraphy pieces in this system are the ones that contain familiar content, so the context of the words helps those familiar with the texts read it. The bigger pieces are still read vertically, column by column.
