Capstone ideation thus far:

## Repeatedly asking the wrong questions

But it was still valuable to ask them anyway.

The questions that keep sticking around are the ones with no definitive answer. Hence circulation and rumination. For some reason I don't take that as a cue to move on. But now I know I need to move in a specific direction and think in more concrete ideas instead of abstract theories. Nothing like deadlines to motivate decision-making. Though good things take time, there is not always time. Good things also take experience to make.

Ben framed it really well: what I should be aiming for is an instructive experience. Learning is what drives me the most and has the longest-lasting impact. It means way more than thoughtlessly making cool-looking things. I wasn't really convinced on the ideas I had for longer than a day because they were more about proving a na√Øve point instead of learning something new and gaining an insight. The truth lies in the process. Outlining objectives will help me determine which project to pick. It's far less dogmatic to approach it this way, which is why my earlier ideas just didn't feel quite right.

How could I forget,

## Learn learn learn (and have some fun)

The balance I'm trying to aim for is manageable form, coherent content/concept, interesting/based on something I know I like, appropriate for long-term work, involves personally relevant precedents and interesting historical examples.

One thing I've noticed is that recently read things really influence what I consider a good idea for a day. I've started looking at enduring interests instead and digging at why certain projects still feel significant even if I've improved since making them.
