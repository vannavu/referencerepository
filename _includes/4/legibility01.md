##### —“but still... stuff... dies?”

I showed my non-designer/artist roommate my CSS typeface and it took her quite a while to be able to read it. It was hilarious. But also great.

Of course it's easy for me to read since I made it, and my peers and designers have been exposed to a greater range of typefaces, making it not too illegible. But for my roommate, it completely blew her mind. The typeface was intentionally unconventional with the horizontal stress and hairline verticals. No curves, no diagonals. And that rendered it largely illegible to her. Seeing her try to decipher letters reminded me of when I did a psychology experiment where I had to try to guess what letter these kindergartners were trying to write. Goes to show how distant designers can get from the average visual perspective. It also has me wondering how much of design is pretentious and really only understandable by designers. It's kind of problematic in the type design world, too, it seems. You really do have to learn about type. It's so niche though that most people outside of it don't care about all the features and technicalities of it. They just want to right-looking thing. Designers are just stylists to a lot of people.

To the general population, does what we do really matter? Do those formal details really add that much more? Or are all these arguments just to bolster our careers and help us continue making a living?

The details cascade into bigger things. It does make an impact. Especially if the decisions we make are rooted in a consistent ideology.
