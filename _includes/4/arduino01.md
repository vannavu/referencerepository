###### — [Arduino receipt printer that outputs posts from the subreddit r/showerthoughts](http://blog.dylanhrush.com/2015/03/thinking-man.html){:target="_blank"}

An idea that has been brewing for a few months now:

Silly and fairly useless idea, but using a receipt printer can relate to commerce on the internet and in real life, and the form of the receipt paper (a long scroll) can be a physical representation of the infinite scroll. Also relates to the idea of search history / viewing history as evidence of consumption. The low resolution of thermal receipt printers also corresponds to the pixel ≠ atom idea.

Using a commercial receipt printer instead of an Arduino one changes the function of the printer from documentation of business transaction to recorder of digital interaction. Consumption of monetarily-valued objects to consumption of mind space.
