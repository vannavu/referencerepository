###### — early result from charette

I am still excited that the CSS typeface is even a project. It's just really fun to see all the possibilities that arise from messing around in a text editor, and exploring another way to make type is just fun fun fun.

The versions I had on Monday made me realize that I was a little too oriented on making variable and layerable fonts, like Typotheque's [History](https://www.typotheque.com/fonts/history){:target="_blank"}. The crit reminded me that the project was about distilling microinteractions, but I'm glad I was given the space to make the different fonts. It's so easy to keep adding, but distilling isn't that hard—once you arrive at a solution. Getting to that confident point requires a lot of trials. I really liked how this project was paced, and how it was all about experimenting then letting the form of the letters and concept guide the decision for choosing the right animation/interaction over a novel one.

## How can the rectangular screen be transformed to feel edgeless? How can the connotations of “infinite scroll” be changed?

Some comments also had me consider the materiality or physics of the webpage again. In the charette I had a version that stretched the letterforms vertically. Ben suggested adding that axis into the randomized glyph width version I showed. I was considering the expandable horizontal space, but not quite the vertical, which is kind of odd considering the common structure of the vertical infinite scroll (and vertical scroll in general over horizontal scroll). I've been thinking about the unbounded webpage a bit.

## Using the browser not only for display and search but also tool-making and physical object production

Jonathan also mentioned how I could use the browser to draft a poster, possibly for the poster class I'm taking. Later I realized that he was getting at using the browser and HTML/CSS as a tool for creating material objects. Amazing. Using code to make generative art is a pretty common thing, but I had not thought about using the browser for that, even though it's basically the same means. It's just a different language of HTML/CSS and Javascript. Getting away from the conventions of the browser can be difficult when you've been using it since childhood.

## What can you do in the browser that you can't do in print?

Another thing I need to consider is how the letterforms interact with the space and the background. The white page is the print and digital default, but there are so many opportunities for dimension, like moving images.

There's too many possibilities in this seemingly endless space. It seems like the only limit is one's knowledge. What are the limits and edges of the internet? I keep trying to understand it in terms of it's basic modules. Microinteractions and pixels are start, but those can be broken down even further. What are the atoms and simple machines of the digital space?
