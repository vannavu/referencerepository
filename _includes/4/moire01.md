###### Python/Drawbot → erroneous bitmapped inkjet print → scanned image

## “Moiré patterns appear in many different situations. In printing, the printed pattern of dots can negatively interfere with the image. In television and digital photography, a pattern on an object being photographed can interfere with the shape of the light sensors to generate unwanted artifacts. They are also sometimes created deliberately – in micrometers they are used to amplify the effects of very small movements.”
###### — [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moir%C3%A9_pattern){:target="_blank"}

Moiré as evidence of noise and distortion that occurs from attempting to compress atoms into pixels or from layering patterns (adding dimension). Also the creation of motion from shifting perspective on static objects.

Static body, moving image vs. active body, static image.
