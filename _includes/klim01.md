[10,000 Original Copies](https://klim.co.nz/blog/10000-original-copies/): Kris Sowersby argues that every interpretation of a preceding typeface is an iteration upon an idea that *moves it forward* and situates it in today's world. Type design is a gradual improvement, moving at the pace of culture and the market. Originality is a false goal. New technologies expand the possible uses of a typeface, but the forms themselves are simply shapes. How is authorship present in type design? What makes a typeface more than a forgery? How is it different from Mona Lisa duplicates?

Typefaces aren't merely facsimiles: well-done ones reflect the designer's ideologies, their knowledge of history, and their craftsmanship.
