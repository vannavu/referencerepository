I made another CSS typeface, though there's not really much attention paid to interaction (though that's not really the point of this). I want to figure out how this thing can actually be typed in its animated form. I don't think it's possible with current font technology; it'd be more of a browser hack. Right now it's just key presses changing opacity.
