For a while I was thinking of making a non-linear phone-sized zine in conjunction with a printed infinite scroll for my capstone. It's more of an art piece than a design piece. But after the capstone meeting I kind of thought I wouldn't really want to spend an entire semester on that, and it's more of a project I would do on the side... I need to just make it. What I'm trying to say with that idea will emerge more once I make it. I also haven't really done much with alternative tools (like a commercial receipt printer) besides small Arduino things and I'm more interested in creating a digitally native project than a print one.

I'm still interested in the form and structure of digital media, but I really ache to do something directly with letterform. I think I'm being timid by not making a typeface. Because really that's what I want to do. So I am probably going to do that. Type is all about rules and parameters. That's what makes it manageable to make. And what makes it fun. The other exciting thing is that type reflects culture and technology. Its form is influenced by how it's made. Part of that includes the maker's tendencies. This all sounds pretty obvious. But basically I've been making things with rules and shapes and language since forever. It's why I was originally a math major. But making rules is way more satisfying than working within predetermined ones. So making a typeface makes a whole lot of sense.

I've been thinking a lot about systems. So I think a parametric typeface would be really interesting, a system of binary switches. It wouldn't be anything groundbreaking or completely new, but that's kind of what a typeface is. For now it will always be based on the alphabet.

I've worked in systematic ways of making type before in terms of modular strokes (stencils) and modular counter shapes on the same starting proportion of a square. My CSS typeface was about applying a strict and simple set of rules on the slab serif form. And this past summer I got some experience with the actual font-making side (though there's still lots to learn, as always). There are many rules I can set to make making a typeface totally manageable, like doing a monospace so that I don't have to spend time kerning or creating a proportionally modular system.

I guess I'm thinking of making type as a program (a phrase I've seen before; need to reread [this article](https://www.typotheque.com/articles/typeface_as_programme){:target="_blank"}). Can I sever it from its analog roots? Probably not but I want to make a type that can really only exist on the screen. Digitally native. It also needs to be contemporary in some way. In conversation with the now. So I'm not really interested in doing a revival; that's more of an exercise. Undoubtedly my typeface will need to be informed by precedents though.

I just really need to make a typeface.
