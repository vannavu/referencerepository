###### — *CodeProfiles* by W. Bradford Paley

“*CodeProfiles* looks at the computer program as text and visually comments on how code is read by people... the amber line follows the fixation point, tracing how people might read the text, line by line; the white line follows the insertion point and flows like the programmer's thoughts, calmly in one place then jumping around to make other parts of the code perform; and the green line moves along the execution point of the program, creating wide swaths where the code was executed thousands of times and appearing as a thin thread where the processor rarely visited.” (from exhibition tag)

## “Paley thereby foregrounds the conceptual nature of all digital art, which is always driven by a language formulating instructions.”

The Whitney museum in New York had an exhibition called *Programmed: Rules, Codes, and Choreographies in Art*. It made light of a lot of themes of why I make what I make and why we're doing what we're doing in the interaction capstone.

###### — *4th wall from Wall Drawing #289* by Sol LeWitt

This Sol LeWitt mural coincidentally looks a lot like [one of the scroll charette things](http://vannavu.com/scroll/charette/32.html){:target="_blank"} I made. Which isn't that crazy; it's just lines and rules and language. What everything is. But how the two are made changes its outcome. A browser vs. crayon and a wall. Reproducibility and multiplicity is a thing to think about with these rule based works. It coincides with the thought that letters are sensitive but not precious.

I guess I'm wondering how redundant it is to keep making stuff that's based on these ideas. What about rules and programs? It's the starting point.
