“[Compression by Abstraction: A Conversation About Vectors](http://rhizome.org/editorial/2013/jul/30/compression-abstraction/){:target="_blank"}” — Rafaël Rozendaal and Jürg Lehni

## “I always felt that using a computer, we should not try to depict the world in ways that were possible before, like photography and video. We should find new ways of depicting. I always felt like pixels are an approximation of reality, and vectors are a reconstruction.”
###### — Rozendaal

Visuals translating onto the screen are approximations. What happens when we create digitally native work, not imitative of reality, but just compositions of light and language?

The aesthetics of digitally produced works: crisp, clean. All roughness is inherently artificial, a simulation. A randomized function is not the same as how rocks erode or how the hand has naturally arising quirks. The physics of digitally native works is up to its creator. Friction and gravity are added. Friction on the web is expressed more strongly through action/experience, not “physical texture,” because there is no “material.”

“I already explained some of the reasons as to why I prefer open software in my various answers. In the end it really has to do with freedom and control. I don’t like being tied into an ecosystem that is provided by one private company. Technology should be our friend, it should be available to all of us, and it should be dynamic like our languages are. I see technology as a core component of our culture, and just like how we all use language and participate in its constant change, we should get to a point where we see technology not as something that controls us and that we are afraid of, but as a liberator, a means of expression, and a catalyst of change.”

Digital work as the ability to be immediately shared via a link, a compression of its form as code, a string of letters.
