<h2>How can we increase knowledge consumption without conflating material consumption? Can you be effective while ignoring “the market”?</h2>

<p>Working within the system vs. working in direct opposition to the system vs. creating a new system :: following the rules vs. breaking the rules vs. making the rules.</p>

<p><em>The Internet Does Not Exist</em> (a collection of e-flux essays): The internet is 100% man-made. There is no nature. What are we constructing in this “endless” space? How much more trash are we creating? What’s being destroyed or abandoned? Do these vacancies matter? Is constantly moving to new locations disruptive? Are text-based communities real?</p>

<p>The internet does not exist separately. It is part of life; it cannot be ignored. It is an extension of man. The Internet with capital I does not exist. Only things exist on the thing we refer to as the internet: the seemingly boundless world inside boxed machines. But the internet is still bounded by country, language, culture, government—the same things that bound the physical world.</p>

<p>The world and “internet” are the same entity. The world has just expanded into another dimension.</p>

<h2>“Disturbingly commonplace”</h2>

<p><em>Statement &amp; Counter-Statement: Notes on Experimental Jetset</em>: A lot of quotes and questions pulled from this… Experimental Jetset represents what it means to speak a language and adhere to an ideology. They also consider all work personal; the dichotomy of client work and personal work does not exist for them. They’re also willing to <em>try</em> writing and expressing opinion, even if it doesn’t come out quite right.</p>

<p><a href="https://klim.co.nz/blog/10000-original-copies/">10,000 Original Copies</a>: Kris Sowersby argues that every interpretation of a preceding typeface is an iteration upon an idea that <em>moves it forward</em> and situates it in today’s world. Type design is a gradual improvement, moving at the pace of culture and the market. Originality is a false goal. New technologies expand the possible uses of a typeface, but the forms themselves are simply shapes. How is authorship present in type design? What makes a typeface more than a forgery? How is it different from Mona Lisa duplicates?</p>

<p>Typefaces aren’t merely facsimiles: well-done ones reflect the designer’s ideologies, their knowledge of history, and their craftsmanship.</p>

<h2>“Remember. Growth is only possible as a product of history. Without memory, innovation is merely novelty. History gives growth a direction. But a memory is never perfect. Every memory is a degraded or composite image of a previous moment or event. That’s what makes us aware of its quality as a past and not a present. It means that every memory is new, a partial construct different from its source, and, as such, a potential for growth itself.”</h2>

<p><em>The Gutenberg Galaxy: The Making of Typographic Man</em> — Marshall McCluhan</p>

<h2>“By the same process whereby he spins language out of his own being, he ensnares himself in it; and each language draws a magic circle round the people to which it belongs, a circle from which there is no escape save by stepping out of it into another.”</h2>
<h6>— Wilhelm von Humboldt</h6>

<p>Learning different languages—linguistic, visual, etc.—enables comparison to one’s defaults (more perspective).</p>

<h2>“By the meaningless sign linked to the meaningless sound we have built the shape and meaning of Western man.”</h2>
<h6>— Marshall McCluhan</h6>

<p>The alphabet is completely abstract, yet it’s the reason why anything is possible at all.</p>

<p>PEOPLE music gathering and website: “Music is for everyone.” A non-hierarchical, non-commercial digital space for artists (mostly musicians) to upload and update unfinished work. Includes some background information on when and where the pieces started.</p>

<p>Note the language: <em>people</em> instead of <em>solo artists</em>, <em>projects</em> instead of <em>bands</em>—reflects the in-progress work (or past sketches) but also the ideology of PEOPLE.</p>

<p>Also note the typography: monospace and all caps of PEOPLE representing equality.</p>

<p>The gathering itself is unscheduled and spontaneous “performances” consist of in-progress work developed during the gathering.</p>

<h2>“You look at our capitalist society and people who are so enthralled with themselves and their own stories because they’re afraid to die. They’re afraid to stop expanding … You don’t need to expand, you don’t need to become Walmart.”</h2>

<h2>“Thinking of [the] guitar as a peer and not a tool.”</h2>

<p>Coincides with the thought of using code as a language, a form of thinking and communicating and not just a tool rather for efficiency. Not only using the computer, but collaborating with it. Specifying code even more, what can you do in browser that you can’t do in Python? Or, how can browser  restrictions influence a design?</p>

<p>“Forget the glass ceiling. Inside a St. Vincent song, you don’t even know where the floor is.” Unexpected, poetic moments vs. novel animations.</p>
