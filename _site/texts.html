<p><em>The Internet Does Not Exist</em> (a collection of e-flux essays): The internet is 100% man-made. There is no nature. What are we constructing in this “endless” space? How much more trash are we creating? What’s being destroyed or abandoned? Do these vacancies matter? Is constantly moving to new locations disruptive? Are text-based communities real?</p>

<p>The internet does not exist separately. It is part of life; it cannot be ignored. It is an extension of man. The Internet with capital I does not exist. Only things exist on the thing we refer to as the internet: the seemingly boundless world inside boxed machines. But the internet is still bounded by country, language, culture, government—the same things that bound the physical world.</p>

<p>The world and “internet” are the same entity. The world has just expanded into another dimension.</p>

<p><em>Statement &amp; Counter-Statement: Notes on Experimental Jetset</em>: A lot of quotes and questions pulled from this… Experimental Jetset represents what it means to speak a language and adhere to an ideology.

They’re also willing to <em>try</em> writing and expressing opinion, even if it doesn’t come out quite right.</p>

<p><em>Modern Typography</em> — Robin Kinross: Thoughts prompted by pages 10–11: Typographic scholarship is largely motivated by the intent to reproduce and sell typefaces modeled on old ones. Do type designers dig deeper than aesthetics?</p>

<p>What ideologies are we reintroducing, repackaging, reiterating…
There’s fun facts, but what about context? Why was the original created in the first place? Does it matter since the connotations of a typeface change based on how they’re used? Do the ideologies of the original designer matter to the contemporary designer? Are contemporary process writings another form of marketing and persuasion?</p>

<p>But does scholarship need to be heightened to make typefaces successful in the market? Nope. And to some, selling is the priority… Can you blame them, considering the speed of society and the long-term process of type design? Are the stakes that high? What are the effects of type on culture, content reception, etc.?</p>

<p>It’s not only about legibility but also about communication and tone. Are the visual qualities of a typeface an argument on their own? An additional voice? Or a characteristic of the whole?</p>

<p>The tricky thing is, the use of a type is not controlled by its designer. Its context is variable. So is an ideology in a face even possible if its use is so varied? What does “authorship” mean in type design?</p>

<p><em>Modern Typography</em> — Robin Kinross: Thoughts prompted by Chapter 2: Enlightenment Origins</p>

<h2>“Modern typography exhibits a rational impulse, both internally in ordering its own working, and externally in the face it presents to the world.”</h2>
<h6>— pg. 16</h6>

<p>“By a typographer, I do not mean a printer, as he is vulgarly accounted, any more than Dr Dee means a carpenter or mason to be an architect: but by a typographer, I mean such a one, who by his own judgement, from solid reasoning within himself, can either perform, or direct others to perform from the beginning to the end, all the handy-works and physical operations relating to typographie.” (Joseph Moxon, <em>Mechanik exercises: or the doctrine of handy-works applied to the art of printing</em>, quoted by Kinross pg. 15).</p>

<p>A typographer is as much as a practitioner as a reasoner, and these things can be taught. Typography is based in reason and rational thought, but it is not a science.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><img src="images/3/romainduroi.jpg" alt="" /></p>
  <h5>— romain du roi italic</h5>
</blockquote>

<p>Romain du roi introduced units for different body sizes and using the grid.
It represents the move toward rationalization and order, and anticipates pixels and how fonts are constructed today (a fine grid of points).</p>

<p>A possibly incorrect assumption of mine: Italics are rooted in handwriting, so what happens when you try to apply that to a grid? An effect of rectilinear units and coordinates is that it leads to sloped romans instead of true italics, which precedes the oblique styles of sans serifs.</p>

<p>Chapter 3: The Nineteenth-Century Complex: Printing was full of working-class labor, roots of underserved, arduous workers:</p>

<p>“They quit, they cheated on their ‘voyage’; they collected small advances on the next week’s work (‘salé’) and then disappeared; and sometimes they spied for rival publishers or the police.” (p.27, Kinross quoting historian of book production in 18th century France). A reminder that things were way more intense back then.</p>

<p>Hard labor motivated workers to take shortcuts to make the work easier, not dissimilar to type designers today using programming and scripting to automate tedious and repetitive processes. Some say it allows more time to be allotted toward designing instead of pixel pushing.</p>

<p>Chapter 4: Reaction and Rebellion:</p>

<h2>“The idea of freedom (‘as having skilled and unaffected boldness’) was essential to [Edward Johnston], as was that of constraint: ‘True spontaneity, however, seems to come from <em>working by rule</em>, but not being bound by it’…‘Set no limit to your hopes (which may contemplate Eternity) but every limit of the moment to your work’”</h2>

<p><a href="https://klim.co.nz/blog/10000-original-copies/">10,000 Original Copies</a>: Kris Sowersby argues that every interpretation of a preceding typeface is an iteration upon an idea that <em>moves it forward</em> and situates it in today’s world. Type design is a gradual improvement, moving at the pace of culture and the market. Originality is a false goal. New technologies expand the possible uses of a typeface, but the forms themselves are simply shapes. How is authorship present in type design? What makes a typeface more than a forgery? How is it different from Mona Lisa duplicates?</p>

<p>Typefaces aren’t merely facsimiles: well-done ones reflect the designer’s ideologies, their knowledge of history, and their craftsmanship.</p>

<h2>“Remember. Growth is only possible as a product of history. Without memory, innovation is merely novelty. History gives growth a direction. But a memory is never perfect. Every memory is a degraded or composite image of a previous moment or event. That’s what makes us aware of its quality as a past and not a present. It means that every memory is new, a partial construct different from its source, and, as such, a potential for growth itself.”</h2>

<p>Microinteractions as frictionless experiences designed around practicality but also emotion: the infinite scroll, the pop of a red heart, the chime of a notification, the unintimidating 280 characters. These microinteractions are designed at the line between tolerable and pleasurable, a seemingly neutral experience with the minimal amount of enjoyment. Blunted.</p>

<h2>Microinteractions triggering other microinteractions like a tweet</h2>

<p>Invisible and seamless microinteractions possibly means gradual erosion of choice and assimilation to screen-based norms. But the repeating friction from new interactions incites online rage. A happy reaction to a microinteraction is a “neutral” one. Passive?</p>

<p>Coincides with the thought of using code as a language, a form of thinking and communicating and not just a tool rather for efficiency. Not only using the computer, but collaborating with it. Specifying code even more, what can you do in browser that you can’t do in Python? Or, how can browser  restrictions influence a design?</p>

How powerful is it to slow down and think about what we’re writing but also think about what the letters mean formally? 140 sans-serif characters? Reactions reduced to a set of 5 emojis?

<p><em>Slow Reader: A Resource for Design Thinking and Practice</em> — Ana Paula Pais &amp; Carolyn F. Strauss (eds.)</p>

<p>Part of the “Long List of <em>Rational</em> Reasons of Why I Like Type Design” is that making a typeface takes a long time. It’s a nice contrast to the rush and immediacy of everything else. The speed of graphic design can sometimes make it feel quite meaningless.</p>

<p>Something that has been stuck in my head is:</p>

<h2>Ephemeral design = ephemeral emotion</h2>

<p>You know when you hold something and it’s just full of emotion? That’s usually because someone put a lot of time and care into it.</p>

<p>The speed in which we design and produce work is tied to life’s timeline and capitalist demands. But not everything is precious and needs years to be made. The alternative of a gradual work is just <em>nice</em>. It’s somewhat of a protest.</p>

<p>With that said, the essays in this book so far touch on systems and language (or at least that’s what I’m choosing to pull out):</p>

<p>“We must learn about how the place where we are is forced upon us in its being, how the powers that be determine our lives, and how we can keep agency in that, and bring our own idea of a relationship.” (pg. 47, “Preparing for the Not-Yet” by Jeanne Van Heeswijk)</p>

<p>“We see words from the economic sphere being applied in the artistic and cultural spheres. A few examples in which I think language really betrays us: to capitalize (ideas), to produce (art), ‘work’ (instead of oeuvre), strategy and ‘projects’ when we refer to the process of creation, while at the same time we let creativity be co-opted by corporate language.</p>

<p>…The lack of criticality and self-reflection in the educational system, the lack of freedom, is intentionally designed as a political instrument. We witness a deliberate imposition on the child of a model of life based on the logic of automatism and the idea of professionalism, which does not allow the child to develop a certain sensitivity.” (pg. 76–77, “The Art of Conversation and the Aesthetic of Process” by Emilio Fantin)</p>

<p>“Often we feel trapped in one system, and we feel the system is so much larger than we are; but we are the ones who are keeping that system going. So once you recognize the inequity, and trace how your own body is being disciplined and kept in a certain place, you can begin to think through how you might design intervention, as a creator of cultural material.” (pg. 90, “Decolonization As Care” by Uzma Z. Rizvi)</p>

<h2>“In all of my experience, however, the mode of resistance has only ever worked through collaboration, finding allies and solidarity with others.”</h2>
<h6>— pg. 94, “Decolonization As Care” by Uzma Z. Rizvi</h6>
