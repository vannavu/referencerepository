<h6>— <em>CodeProfiles</em> by W. Bradford Paley</h6>

<p>“<em>CodeProfiles</em> looks at the computer program as text and visually comments on how code is read by people… the amber line follows the fixation point, tracing how people might read the text, line by line; the white line follows the insertion point and flows like the programmer’s thoughts, calmly in one place then jumping around to make other parts of the code perform; and the green line moves along the execution point of the program, creating wide swaths where the code was executed thousands of times and appearing as a thin thread where the processor rarely visited.” (from exhibition tag)</p>

<h2>“Paley thereby foregrounds the conceptual nature of all digital art, which is always driven by a language formulating instructions.”</h2>

<p>The Whitney museum in New York had an exhibition called <em>Programmed: Rules, Codes, and Choreographies in Art</em>. It made light of a lot of themes of why I make what I make and why we’re doing what we’re doing in the interaction capstone.</p>

<h6>— <em>4th wall from Wall Drawing #289</em> by Sol LeWitt</h6>

<p>This Sol LeWitt mural coincidentally looks a lot like <a href="http://vannavu.com/scroll/charette/32.html" target="_blank">one of the scroll charette things</a> I made. Which isn’t that crazy; it’s just lines and rules and language. What everything is. But how the two are made changes its outcome. A browser vs. crayon and a wall. Reproducibility and multiplicity is a thing to think about with these rule based works. It coincides with the thought that letters are sensitive but not precious.</p>

<p>I guess I’m wondering how redundant it is to keep making stuff that’s based on these ideas. What about rules and programs? It’s the starting point.</p>

<p>Thoughts so far—</p>

<p>I’m not really interested in closed-control or specifically designed outcomes. Even if the outcome is unexpected for other people, it’s more satisfying when the outcome is unexpected for everyone. I want to learn from other people’s makings as much as my own. I’m interested in open-ended systems. It’s also why I’m interested in tools and type design. Tools carry the creation of something else. A typeface needs to be used, not just displayed, and it’s meaning changes as it is used. Letters are sensitive but not precious.</p>

<p>I still keep thinking about the idea of text-based communities. What could they be, beyond a forum or something like Twitter?</p>

<h2>What is truly native about the browser?</h2>

<p>A lot of sites function to redirect us to content. What about stand-alone sites? How can an experience be native to its environment, rather than a metaphor of something that exists? Everything is metaphor, a translation. What about the raw materials and ideas of the internet?</p>

<p>That’s what atom≠pixel means: the base units of digital and analog are not the same, so the larger structures created from that are not equivalent. So why attempt translation from physical to digital? Basically, art serving to be  representational vs. art as art.</p>

<p>I’m wondering about making the intangible structures of the internet/browser explicit, its expanding rectangles, link pathways, but also its relationship to the whole world—because again, the internet has expanded the dimension of the world; it’s not another, separate world.</p>

<p>So instead of thinking of the internet as branches of “walled gardens”, I’m trying to think of it as one room expanding (like in the Sims 4…).</p>

<p><img src="images/6/thesims.gif" alt="" /></p>

<p>Because the webpage or Google Doc is an organic (but potentially immortal), editable document, eternal as the same object but ephemeral in its appearance, function, state, etc. Like a piece of land. That can be copy and pasted. But not named the same.</p>

<p>What is natural about the internet? It’s completely man-made. We’ve built this expansion, but do we understand it?</p>

<p>I’m seeing why investigating the internet for what it <em>is</em>, content-wise and structurally, rather than whether it’s good or bad is a way of understanding it. Since the internet is not a separate world but a layer of it, it will proportionally reflect the dominant culture of commercialism and commerce. But it’s not just that (and it’s not realistic to think of it as something where commercialism and commerce are the minority).</p>

<p>The internet vs. an internet: it’s whatever you want it to be.</p>

<h6>— <a href="http://juerglehni.com/works/viktor" target="_blank">Viktor</a>, robotic chalk drawing machine</h6>

<p>Was reintroduced to <a href="http://juerglehni.com/" target="_blank">Jürg Lehni</a>, and looking at his work beyond <a href="http://juerglehni.com/works/apple-talk" target="_blank">Apple Talk</a> got me thinking about not just human error affecting digital platforms, but how Earth’s physics affect precise, programmed tools.</p>

<h2>The physics of the internet vs. the physics of Earth</h2>

<p>His project “Viktor” is also a nice resolution of the conflict between genuine roughness of material and electronically powered machines.</p>

<p>Jürg was also one of the people who made Scriptographer. Go figure.</p>

<p>The intersection of type, tech, and our relationship to digital forms and the internet is where it’s at.</p>

<h6>Python/Drawbot → erroneous bitmapped inkjet print → scanned image</h6>

<h2>“Moiré patterns appear in many different situations. In printing, the printed pattern of dots can negatively interfere with the image. In television and digital photography, a pattern on an object being photographed can interfere with the shape of the light sensors to generate unwanted artifacts. They are also sometimes created deliberately – in micrometers they are used to amplify the effects of very small movements.”</h2>
<h6>— <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moir%C3%A9_pattern" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a></h6>

<p>Moiré as evidence of noise and distortion that occurs from attempting to compress atoms into pixels or from layering patterns (adding dimension). Also the creation of motion from shifting perspective on static objects.</p>

<h6>— <a href="http://blog.dylanhrush.com/2015/03/thinking-man.html" target="_blank">Arduino receipt printer that outputs posts from the subreddit r/showerthoughts</a></h6>

<p>An idea that has been brewing for a few months now: print my Instagram feed.</p>

<p>Using a receipt printer can relate to commerce on the internet and in real life, and the form of the receipt paper (a long scroll) can be a physical representation of the infinite scroll. Also relates to the idea of search history / viewing history as evidence of consumption. The low resolution of thermal receipt printers also corresponds to the pixel ≠ atom idea.</p>

<p>Using a commercial receipt printer instead of an Arduino one changes the function of the printer from documentation of business transaction to recorder of digital interaction. Consumption of monetarily-valued objects to consumption of mind space.</p>

<p>I made another CSS typeface, though there’s not really much attention paid to interaction (though that’s not really the point of this). I want to figure out how this thing can actually be typed in its animated form. I don’t think it’s possible with current font technology; it’d be more of a browser hack. Right now it’s just key presses changing opacity.</p>
