<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25exf6OowfU&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=2m24s" target="_blank">David Berlow on emojis</a>: Berlow talks about how monolinear sans serifs are neutral in their ubiquity across textual communication. Emojis carry expression now. The contrast keeps getting revved up: original black and white emoticons evolving into full color mini-illustrations. Emojis are an interesting development in written communication…</p>

<h6>— pg. 110, quoting Karl Gerstner, set in Gerstner Original</h6>

<p><em>Idea Document: On the Shoulders of Giants</em>: Notable problem is that this features mostly white European guys. But that goes for most type design books. Insightful nonetheless. Learned about Gernster’s font that intends to synthesize serif and sans, as well as André Ballinger’s Newut Tip, which is “an attempt to create a new universal typeface.“</p>

<p>“German texts always had a more ragged grayscale than the Latinate or Anglo-Saxon texts due to many capitalised words. When looking at the German immediately next to the other languages, it always draws slightly more attention visually.” (All nouns in German are capitalized.)
Baldinger, (<em>IDEA Document: On the Shoulders of Giants</em>, pg. 104).</p>

<p>The dots stand in for accent marks. Since words are understood in context, the dots work.</p>

<p><a href="https://klim.co.nz/blog/10000-original-copies/">10,000 Original Copies</a>: Kris Sowersby argues that every interpretation of a preceding typeface is an iteration upon an idea that <em>moves it forward</em> and situates it in today’s world. Type design is a gradual improvement, moving at the pace of culture and the market. Originality is a false goal. New technologies expand the possible uses of a typeface, but the forms themselves are simply shapes. How is authorship present in type design? What makes a typeface more than a forgery? How is it different from Mona Lisa duplicates?</p>

<p>Typefaces aren’t merely facsimiles: well-done ones reflect the designer’s ideologies, their knowledge of history, and their craftsmanship.</p>

<p><em>The Gutenberg Galaxy: The Making of Typographic Man</em> — Marshall McCluhan</p>

<h2>“By the same process whereby he spins language out of his own being, he ensnares himself in it; and each language draws a magic circle round the people to which it belongs, a circle from which there is no escape save by stepping out of it into another.”</h2>
<h6>— Wilhelm von Humboldt</h6>

<p>Learning different languages—linguistic, visual, etc.—enables comparison to one’s defaults (more perspective).</p>

<h2>“By the meaningless sign linked to the meaningless sound we have built the shape and meaning of Western man.”</h2>
<h6>— Marshall McCluhan</h6>

<p>The alphabet is completely abstract, yet it’s the reason why anything is possible at all.</p>

<p>PEOPLE music gathering and website: “Music is for everyone.” A non-hierarchical, non-commercial digital space for artists (mostly musicians) to upload and update unfinished work. Includes some background information on when and where the pieces started.</p>

<p>Note the language: <em>people</em> instead of <em>solo artists</em>, <em>projects</em> instead of <em>bands</em>—reflects the in-progress work (or past sketches) but also the ideology of PEOPLE.</p>

<p>Also note the typography: monospace and all caps of PEOPLE representing equality.</p>

<p>The gathering itself is unscheduled and spontaneous “performances” consist of in-progress work developed during the gathering.</p>

<h2>“You look at our capitalist society and people who are so enthralled with themselves and their own stories because they’re afraid to die. They’re afraid to stop expanding … You don’t need to expand, you don’t need to become Walmart.”</h2>
