<p><a href="https://walkerart.org/magazine/kyuha-q-shim-interview-computation-design" target="_blank">Vocabularies of Computation: An Interview with Kyuha (Q) Shim</a>:</p>

<h2>“After all, there are many ways to draw an outlined circle.”</h2>

<p>“Computation is, first and foremost, my primary medium. It is a lens with which and through which I take an analytical perspective to see things as generative pattern, a combination of parameters and algorithms. Not everything is made out of rules, but I love to decode logic encrypted in artifacts. At the same time, computation is a material with which I build systems that can automatically repeat tasks, which yields continuity and actually feels like real-time. It enables me to play with contingent, complex, data-driven, and improvisational aspects of formation.”</p>

<p>The interviewer also asks,</p>

<h2>“Can an algorithm have style?”</h2>

<p>Shim responds by saying that depending on the rules, yes, an algorithm can have style due to the visual patterns that it creates.</p>
