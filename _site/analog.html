<h6>— <em>The Candle Clock in the Citadel</em> by Diana Al-Hadid, 2017. In which Al-Hadid attempts to reconstruct a complicated machine like a badass.</h6>

<p>Diana Al-Hadid’s talk on Wednesday was about historical synthesis and new form. It was new to witness an artist give a less prepared/scripted talk, as she seemed to intend. She was using the public space as a means of reflecting on work in a new setting, which probably put some people off as she searched for words. But to me it made her more empathetic. She’s still figuring things out like everyone else. And the work as a collection speaks.</p>

<p>Her experiences show that the work is not coincidental, that it does not come from some mysterious, unknown source. Experimental Jetset calls on the same theme of origins in <em>Statement and Counter-Statement</em>. It’s getting at the question:</p>

<h2>“What were my atoms before they were me?”</h2>

<p>I’ve been thinking about the why’s of what I do a lot; the roots are traceable, and influences are everywhere. My parents own a nail salon, and doing nails is not dissimilar to the practice of graphic design. Creative labor. A service. … That’s just one part of the big Why.</p>

<h6>— <a href="http://blog.dylanhrush.com/2015/03/thinking-man.html" target="_blank">Arduino receipt printer that outputs posts from the subreddit r/showerthoughts</a></h6>

<p>An idea that has been brewing for a few months now: print my Instagram feed.</p>

<p>Using a receipt printer can relate to commerce on the internet and in real life, and the form of the receipt paper (a long scroll) can be a physical representation of the infinite scroll. Also relates to the idea of search history / viewing history as evidence of consumption. The low resolution of thermal receipt printers also corresponds to the pixel ≠ atom idea.</p>

<p>Using a commercial receipt printer instead of an Arduino one changes the function of the printer from documentation of business transaction to recorder of digital interaction. Consumption of monetarily-valued objects to consumption of mind space.</p>

<p>In my bookbinding class we are <a href="https://youtu.be/8svE2AjQWYE?t=40m59s" target="_blank">making paper</a> as well as getting a hang of the letterpress. This week has been about experimenting. My group made a mega-paper/community-quilt-type-thing, and it’s honestly kind of meaningful as cheesy and sort of cliché-y as it might me. We just pressed multiple sheets of paper together, and there ended up being a space in the middle from human error and imperfect alignment. The physical negative space also shows that the paper was made from multiple modules. The paper was pressed in a sort of American flag shape with the larger rectangle in the corner, but the whole sheet is one color, which happened to be a blueberry-smoothie color from mixing white pulp with red and blue dye. It was a whole lot of serendipity but also about enabling those moments by saying yes to trying simple but new things.</p>

<p>In any case it’s pretty nice learning more about paper production and taking the time to collaboratively make these things by hand. Getting back on the letterpress is also nice; cranking the rollers, setting the letters. Craft is a good way to slow down and digest and to get intimate with the materials we use to communicate ideas. Sometimes design feels too sterile and clean. Frictionless. The imitation of letterpress aesthetics on the screen also feels disingenuous. So what is native about digitally-based media?</p>

<p><em><a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/ans7870/21f/21f.027/dianshizhai/dsz_essay01.html" target="_blank">Dianshizhai Pictorial</a></em>: This was a Shanghai-based magazine that was published after the establishment of <em>Shenbao</em>, a newspaper founded by the Englishman Ernest Major. The spread above is from the first volume and represents the different image-making methods and dominant technologies of the Chinese (woodblock prints) and Westerners (photography).</p>

<h6>— “Escape from Danger” by Ma Ziming, vol. 2, 1884.</h6>

<h2>Synthesis, not assimilation</h2>

<p>This second spread shows the synthesis of East and West and reflects Shanghai’s culture and population as a trading port. Western technologies were introduced to the Chinese, and lithography pushed past the limitations of woodblock printing, allowing for greater volumes in mass-production along with more detailed prints. Here technology influences form and content, but does not completely override tradition.</p>

<h6>— 2014</h6>

<p>I took an accidental glitch-panorama of the Arch the summer before senior year of high school. It reflected the state of St. Louis.</p>

<p>The summer of 2017 I studied abroad in Florence. Our final project was about collection and curation. One of my classmates/friends Laurie did hers on glitch panoramas. It resulted in many silly pictures, but in the end considered the possibilities of interaction for divided panels of panoramas.</p>

<h6>— 2018</h6>

<p>The Sunday of Labor Day weekend, I went to the newly renovated Arch and took some more panoramas, this time deliberately contorting the Arch. The glitch panorama has a new meaning and association and is inseparable from Laurie’s project now, for me and for the people I studied abroad with. Community impacts the work, and connotations can’t be forgotten. But what do these photos mean to others?</p>

<h6>— <a href="http://juerglehni.com/works/viktor" target="_blank">Viktor</a>, robotic chalk drawing machine</h6>

<p>Was reintroduced to <a href="http://juerglehni.com/" target="_blank">Jürg Lehni</a>, and looking at his work beyond <a href="http://juerglehni.com/works/apple-talk" target="_blank">Apple Talk</a> got me thinking about not just human error affecting digital platforms, but how Earth’s physics affect precise, programmed tools.</p>

<h2>The physics of the internet vs. the physics of Earth</h2>

<p>His project “Viktor” is also a nice resolution of the conflict between genuine roughness of material and electronically powered machines.</p>

<p>Jürg was also one of the people who made Scriptographer. Go figure.</p>

<p>The intersection of type, tech, and our relationship to digital forms and the internet is where it’s at.</p>

<h6>Python/Drawbot → erroneous bitmapped inkjet print → scanned image</h6>

<h2>“Moiré patterns appear in many different situations. In printing, the printed pattern of dots can negatively interfere with the image. In television and digital photography, a pattern on an object being photographed can interfere with the shape of the light sensors to generate unwanted artifacts. They are also sometimes created deliberately – in micrometers they are used to amplify the effects of very small movements.”</h2>
<h6>— <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moir%C3%A9_pattern" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a></h6>

<p>Moiré as evidence of noise and distortion that occurs from attempting to compress atoms into pixels or from layering patterns (adding dimension). Also the creation of motion from shifting perspective on static objects.</p>

<p>Static body, moving image vs. active body, static image.</p>
